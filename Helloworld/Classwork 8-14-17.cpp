	//1. Select suitable variable types and names for the following examples
	//a) The average height of students in your class
	float avgHeight;
	//b) The tax rate for incomes over $65000
	float taxrateIncomesOver65000;
	//c) The tax rate for incomes below $5000
	float rateBelow5k;
	//d) The total cost of all the games on your Steam library
	float costAllGames;

	//2. Select suitable data types to hold the following values :
	//a) 121
	int;
	//b) 9.4
	float;
	//c) r
	char;
	//d) 100000

	//e) False

		//3. Create a program that swaps two numbers. Ask the user for 2 numbers in the console window
		//and store the result in variables called “a” and “b” print the result to screen.Write code 
		//that swaps the values for these variables, then print the variables “a” and “b” again.
		//You should comment your code.

				//get user input for values
				//print the values of a and 
				//b to the screen
				a=c
				b=a
				c=b
				
	//4. Ask the user for 5 numbers and output the average of these numbers.		
	
			   int 5numAvg =  90 
		
	//5. Redo question 3 but allows the user to input the values to be swapped and provide information
	//in the console proving the data was swapped.
